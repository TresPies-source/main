🧭 3D Expansion Summary for ZenJar
🌐 Core Concept
Turn each Jar (Task, Gratitude, Motivation, Intention, Win) into a beautifully animated, rotatable, openable, and fillable 3D object — living inside a WebGL scene that responds to mood and input.

🪄 Key Imaginative Enhancements
🧱 Jars in 3D
Fully modeled: Custom GLTF or glb files for each jar type.

Behavior: Rotate, open lid, glow gently, and animate on item drop.

Fillable: Each added item becomes a visible object inside the jar (scrolls, light orbs, affirmations).

✨ Drag & Drop Interactions
Use @react-three/drei for pointer detection and drag controls.

use-gesture or rapier physics for natural item movement.

Dropped objects trigger:

Sound (via tone.js)

Particle effects (e.g., ripple rings, sparks)

Jar “fill” animation or glow pulse

🌌 Zen Mode
Toggle into immersive mode:

Floating scene in space, forest, or beneath water

Parallax layers and particle skies

Timer floats softly

UI fades away

🌳 Growth View (Later Phases)
“Zoom out” from jars into a garden or celestial constellation

Constellation lights up with accomplishments (wins, focus, gratitude)

Unlock new environments as milestones are hit

🔉 Audio + Ambience
Scene-based ambient tracks: Lo-fi rain, synth forest, wind cave, etc.

Item-specific SFX:

Tasks = parchment scroll flutter

Gratitude = sparkle pop

Wins = gong or piano chime

🧠 ZenSpeak: Voice to Object
Speak: “Add task: Send email to Joy”

Visual: Scroll unrolls in air → user drags it into jar

Visual feedback from mic icon, and optional “whispering guide” response
