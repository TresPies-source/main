**Risks and Mitigation Strategies**
- **Risk:** AI Model Limitations/Cost:
  - **Mitigation:** Start with `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` for cost-effectiveness. Optimize prompts and data structures to minimize token usage. Implement rate limiting on AI calls if needed.
- **Risk:** Cross-Platform Complexity:
  - **Mitigation:** Centralize business logic in Firebase Cloud Functions. Develop platform-specific frontends as thin clients. Prioritize one platform (Web App) for initial stability before expanding.
- **Risk:** Data Persistence & Security:
  - **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to Firestore security rules (`request.auth.uid == userId` for private data, `request.auth != null` for public data). Ensure all data operations are authenticated. Implement robust data validation and error handling for all incoming/outgoing data, especially with third-party integrations.
- **Risk:** Third-Party API Changes/Deprecations:
  - **Mitigation:** Stay updated on API documentation for Google and other integrated services. Abstract API calls behind service layers in Cloud Functions to minimize impact of changes. Implement monitoring for API errors.
- **Risk:** Scope Creep:
  - **Mitigation:** Maintain a clear MVP definition for each phase. Strictly prioritize features based on value. Defer non-essential features to future phases.
- **Risk:** Performance Bottlenecks:
  - **Mitigation:** Monitor Firebase usage. Optimize Firestore queries (avoid `orderBy()` where possible, use client-side sorting). Implement loading states and debouncing for intensive operations, especially with external API calls.
- **Risk:** Content Management for Public Site:
  - **Mitigation:** Utilize a headless CMS or Markdown-based content system for the blog and static pages to allow for easy updates without code deployments.
- **Risk:** AI Agent Integration Security & Data Privacy:
  - **Mitigation:** Implement strict authentication and authorization for any external AI agents. Ensure user consent is obtained for data access. Clearly define what data external agents can access and modify. Adhere to all relevant data privacy regulations.
